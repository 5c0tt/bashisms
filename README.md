###Bashisms that I can't always remember###

I use an app called LightPaper, which allows me to type in MarkDown, and see a live preview pane of what the resulting MarkDown will look like.

I will publish this file to github every time I add something new.

I would love others to help clean up and add to it.  The notion is to keep these as one linters, or snippets of no more than around 8 lines.  Don't sweat it if you are 10 lines, I would rather see 10 lines than some crafty hard to understand one liner just to meet an arbitrary 8 line requirement.
