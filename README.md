# Bashisms

## bash and shell commands I can't always remember, but use often
I use an app called [LightPaper](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/) which allows me to type in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and see a live preview pane of what the resulting MarkDown will look like.

I have also been playing with [MOU](http://mouapp.com), though it may need some work to compete. I believe both are free, and both shine in some areas, where both need polish in others.

The nice thing is, the file remains a plain text file, LightPaper adds nothing special to it other than telling the OS to open all .md files in LightPaper.

I will [publish this file]("https://github.com/5c0tt/bashisms/blob/master/bashisms.md") to github every time I add something new.

## How you can help
I would love others to help clean up and add to it.  The notion is to keep these as one linters, or snippets of no more than around 8 lines.  Don't sweat it if you are 10 lines, I would rather see 10 lines than some crafty hard to understand one liner just to meet an arbitrary 8 line requirement.

If you are interested in helping, just follow me, or join, or do whatever it is that you do in github to become a contributor.  I am a first time user, so this is all knew to me.  For example, someone could pull this [README.md](README.md) file down and change this part here I say "I don't know what I am doing" and add in instructions on how others can help.

It may be a good idea to separate out this file into parts, as there are some very Mac OS X specific commands in the [bashisms.md](bashisms.md) file.
