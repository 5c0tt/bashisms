# Bashisms

## bash and shell commands I can't always remember, but use often.
I use an app called **[LightPaper](http://clockworkengine.com/lightpaper-mac/) which allows me to type in [MarkDown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and see a live preview pane of what the resulting MarkDown will look like.

I have also been playing with [MOU](http://mouapp.com), though it may need some work to compete. I believe both are free, and both shine in some areas, where both need polish in others.

The nice thing is, the file remains a plain text file, LightPaper adds nothing special to it other than telling the OS to open all .md files in LightPaper.

I will [publish this file]("https://github.com/5c0tt/bashisms/blob/master/bashisms.md") to github every time I add something new.

## For now, the solution is LightPaper, it is more mature, and the developer is more responsive in my personal opinion.

## How you can help?
I would love others to help clean up and add to it.  The notion is to keep these as one liners, or snippets of no more than around 8 lines.  Don't sweat it if you are 10 lines, I would rather see 10 lines than some crafty hard to understand one liner just to meet an arbitrary 8 line requirement.

    $foo = ( $bar = "ploppity" ? $p = "A" : $p = "B" ) ? "this" : "that";
    
Or whatever it would be, that is unreadable, impossible, and aggravating when I see "*ternary code*" like that.  Nested!  Whoa Bro!    

If you are interested in helping, just follow me, or join, or do whatever it is that you do in github to become a contributor.  I am a first time *GitHub* user, so this is all new to me.

For example, someone could pull this README.md file down and change this part here to say *"I don't know what I am doing"* and add in instructions on how others can help.

It may be a good idea to separate out "bashisms.md" into parts, as there are some very Mac OS X specific commands in the "bashisms.md" file.
